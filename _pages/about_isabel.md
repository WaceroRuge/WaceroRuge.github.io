Her research focuses on the development of methods for reliably estimating (especially poverty or inequality indicators) in population subgroups, using statistical models that combine data from surveys with data from other data sources.

She is the author (with JNK Rao) of the reference book on this topic, entitled "Small Area Estimation". She has published guides on this topic for two United Nations regional commissions and over 40 research articles and she has been the principal investigator on the European SAMPLE project (http://www.sample-project.eu/).

Isabel has received, among others, the Ramiro Melendreras Prize from the Spanish Society of Statistics and Operational Research in 2001, the "Best Paper Award 2010" from the Canadian Statistical Society, and the Royal Academy of Sciences Young Female Scientific Talent Award in 2021.

Several of the methods developed with her collaborators have been implemented and adopted by the World Bank.
