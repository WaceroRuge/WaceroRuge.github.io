In this seminar, we combine two methodologies used in the model-based survey sampling, namely
the prediction of the finite population total, named T, under informative sampling and full
response, and the prediction of T with a noninformative sampling design and the nonignorable
nonresponse mechanism.he former approach involves the dependence of the first order inclusion
probabilities on the study variable, while the latter involves the dependence of the probability of
nonresponse on unobserved or missing observations. The main aim of the seminar is to consider
how to account for the joint effects of informative sampling designs and not missing-at-random
response mechanism in survey sampling. For this purpose, theoretically, we use the response
distribution and relationships between the moments of the superpopulation, the sample, sample-
complement, response, and nonresponse distributions for the prediction of finite population totals.
This is the most general situation in surveys and other combinations of sampling informativeness
and response mechanisms can be considered as special cases. Furthermore, based on the
relationship between response distribution and population distribution, we introduce a new
measure of the representativeness of a response set and a new test of nonignorable nonresponse
and informative sampling, jointly. Finally, a calibration estimator is obtained when the sampling
design is informative and the nonresponse mechanism is nonignorable.
